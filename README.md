# Instructions
Put it in your gamemodes init.lua and cl_init.lua, if you don't know how to set this up then don't use it.

# Credits
I just found this on my old box, used it for server announcments.
Don't remember who actually made the source for the tts, just made it where it can catch strings through a concommand, and where its global.
